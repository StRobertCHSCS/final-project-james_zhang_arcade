# My Ducky Bouncing Game !
## Objective of the game
The objective of my game is to create an interacting simulation of turtles bouncing ducks. In order to complete the game you must completer all x levels of the game, where each level will make the game more difficult. The player should have fun while playing the game.

## Gameplay Instructions
To control the movement of the turtle you will be using the D and A keys, to move right and left. You will be controlling the turtle to bounce the ducks to the other side of the land, the ducks will be constantly jumping into the river, so you must move your turtle under them to bounce them.

## Scoring 
Everytime you bring a duck to the other side, your score will be increased by 1.

## Functionality and Limitations
Some limitations of my game are that you cannot use your mouse to control the turtle, (will think of more when done)
