# My Ducky Bouncing Game 
- Objective of the game
The objective of my game is to create an interacting simulation of turtles bouncing ducks. The purpose is so that the player will have fun while playing my game.

- Gameplay Instructions
To control the movement of the turtle you will be either using you left and right arrow keys or the D and A keys, to your preference.

- Scoring 
Everytime you bring a duck to the other side, your score will be increased by 1.

- Functionality and Limitations
Some limitations of my game are that you cannot use your mouse to control the turtle, (will think of more when done)
